# Mini Project for CAP4613 (Applied Deep Learning)
Project Title: Object Detection with Point Cloud for Autonomous Navigation 
 
## Project Overview
This project will introduce us to 3D object detection using LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) Point Cloud (A collection of 3D points that repreent the shape of an object or space) Data. This will help us understand practical applications of deep neural networks for autonomos vehicle navigation.

## Dataset

## Tools and Skills
Programming: Python
Libraries: PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, Open3D (STC)
Key Concepts: CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), LiDAR Data, Object Detection
