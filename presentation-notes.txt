1. Dataset Exploration & Preprocessing
o Have you downloaded the dataset?
    Yes! we are using a subset of 3D Object Detection dataset from KITTI
o What are the characteristics of the dataset (size, format, labels, etc.)?

o What preprocessing steps are needed?

o Do you need APIs for data manipulation?

o Show us your dataset




2. Learning Approach
o Which deep learning technique will you use (CNN, RNN, Transformer, etc.)?
    We will use CNNs.

o Are you going to use a pre-train model ?, Will you be training the model from
scratch?, are you fine tuning a model ?
    We will most likely use a pre-trained model, however we want to atleast try and 
    implement a model from scratch just for the experience.

o Why did you choose this method over others?
    Just cause, we want the experience in both areas.





3. Proposed Model Architecture
o Present an initial model diagram and explain its key components.

o What modifications/customizations do you plan to implement?




4. Implementation Plan & Timeline
o Provide a structured plan for different stages of the project:
▪ Dataset preparation

▪ Model selection & training

▪ Evaluation & performance metrics

▪ Optimization & fine-tuning

▪ Final testing & reporting



5. Challenges & Questions
o Identify possible challenges and any questions regarding the implementation
